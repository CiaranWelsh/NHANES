# NHANES package NEWS

## NHANES 2.0

 * Major reworking of the `NHANES` data set.  Variables have been recoded and renamed.  More importantly, the `NHANES` data set now reflects the sampling used in the NHANES study and can now be used as something resembling a simple random sample from the American population.  See the help pages for more details.
 * `NHANESraw` contains that data not adjusted for the weighting scheme used in sampling.  This is a better version of the original `NHANES` data and coded to match the new `NHANES` data set.  Again, seee the help pages for more details.

## NHANES 1.0
